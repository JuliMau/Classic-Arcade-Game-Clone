# **Classic Arcade Game Clone**
This is a classic arcade game, where a player should get from one point to another trying to avoid collisions with obstacles.
### **About the Game**
Your player is waiting at the bottom of the canvas, and it should move forward from the grass across the road towards the sea.

### **Game Conditions**
Move your player by pressing arrow keys one step at a time, and try to avoid collisions with bugs that are continuously appearing on the road.
You will see your _score above the game board. One counted move corresponds to one step made by the player.

#### **Timer**
Here is no timer.

#### **Score**
The scoring starts upon the first move, and one point corresponds to each step. The points will be cumulated, but if your player collides with a bug on its way, all points will be lost and counter will be set to 0.
In addition, your player will be returned to the starting point at the right bottom corner.

#### **Congratulation Panel**

When the game is over you will see a congratulation panel.
You can restart your game by pressing "Restart" -button.
